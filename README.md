# Game Playing Agent: Isolation

## Goal

The goal of this project is to be able to develop an adversarial search agent to
play the game of isolation. Isolation is a deterministic, two player game in which
the player alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on the
board. The player who has no remaining moves first, loses.

- `MinimaxPlayer.minimax()`: implement minimax search
- `AlphaBetaPlayer.alphabeta()`: implement minimax search with alpha-beta pruning
- `AlphaBetaPlayer.get_move()`: implement iterative deepening search
- `custom_score()`: implement your own best position evaluation heuristic
- `custom_score_2()`: implement your own alternate position evaluation heuristic
- `custom_score_3()`: implement your own alternate position evaluation heuristic

## What this doesn't include

This repo does not currently include the research review on the paper 'Deep Blue'
by IBM, the heuristic analysis of the algorithms, and the tests, but can be requested.
